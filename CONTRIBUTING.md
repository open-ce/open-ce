## Contributing to Open-CE
Our project welcomes external contributions.

To contribute code or documentation, please submit a [pull request](https://github.com/open-ce/open-ce/pulls).

A good way to familiarize yourself with the codebase and contribution process is
to look for and tackle low-hanging fruit in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/open-ce/open-ce/issues).
Before embarking on a more ambitious contribution, please quickly [get in touch](#communication) with us.

Note: We appreciate your effort, and want to avoid a situation where a contribution
requires extensive rework (by you or by us), sits in backlog for a long time, or
cannot be accepted at all!

### Proposing new features

If you would like to implement a new feature, please [raise an issue](https://github.com/open-ce/open-ce/issues)
before sending a pull request so the feature can be discussed. This is to avoid
you wasting your valuable time working on a feature that the project developers
are not interested in accepting into the code base.

Note that this project is primarily comprised of build scripts and infrastructure, so there is not very
much opportunity for fuunctionality-based feature additions here. In most cases, a feature would more commonly
involve updating feedstock package versions or dependencies, or introducing build or test efficiencies.

### Fixing bugs

If you would like to fix a bug, please [raise an issue](https://github.com/open-ce/open-ce/issues) before sending a
pull request so it can be tracked.

### Merge approval

A change requires an approval from two of the maintainers of each component affected.
When you are satisfied with your pull request, add one or more of the maintainers as an approver.

For a list of the maintainers, see the [MAINTAINERS.md](MAINTAINERS.md) page.

## Legal

By submitting, you agree that your contribution is supplied under the Apache V2.0 license.

We have tried to make it as easy as possible to make contributions. This
applies to how we handle the legal aspects of contribution. We use the
same approach - the [Developer's Certificate of Origin 1.1 (DCO)](https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric/blob/main/docs/source/DCO1.1.txt) - that the LinuxÂ® Kernel [community](https://elinux.org/Developer_Certificate_Of_Origin)
uses to manage code contributions.

We simply ask that when submitting a patch for review, the developer
must include a sign-off statement in the commit message.

Here is an example Signed-off-by line, which indicates that the
submitter accepts the DCO:

```
Signed-off-by: John Doe <john.doe@email.example.com>
```

You can include this automatically when you commit a change to your
local git repository using the following command:

```
git commit -s
```

## Communication
Please feel free to connect with us by [raising issues](https://github.com/open-ce/open-ce/issues) as described above or by contacting one of the project maintainers as found in the [MAINTAINERS.md](MAINTAINERS.md) page.

In addition, this project has an online gitter community forum which you may join in order to communicate with us, ask questions, and discuss project-related topics. You can find the forum here:
