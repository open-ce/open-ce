## Open-CE Tests

Open-CE provides tools for running tests for packages built by the Open-CE tools. To add tests to a feedstock, create a file named `tests/open-ce-tests.yaml`. The test can include a list of tests that will be run within a newly generated conda environment that should include the packages being built by the feedstock.

### Open-CE Test File

An Open-CE Test file is a YAML file that describes the tests that will be run. The test files can also include jinja code. Below is a simple example of a test file:

```yaml
tests:
  - name: First Test
    command: |
      cd my_package
      pytest -v tests
{% if build_type == 'cuda' %}
  - name: CUDA Test
    command: |
      cd my_package
      pytest -v cuda_tests
{% endif %}
```

This example will:

1. Create a new conda environment that will be active throughout the running of the tests.
1. Run the bash instructions specified by `command` in "First Test" within a new bash shell that activates the conda environment from step 1.
1. If running within a CUDA environment, run the bash instructions specified by `command` in "CUDA Test" within a new bash shell that activates the conda environment from step 1.
1. Removes the conda environment created in step 1.

#### Open-CE Test File Environment Variables

The following environment variables can be referenced within the command section of an Open-CE test:

| Environment Variable | Description |
| -------------------- | ----------- |
| FEEDSTOCK_DIR        | Path of the feedstock directory containing the test |

### Test Labels

Labels can be added to tests using jinja. Labels can be activated using the `--test_labels` argument to the `open-ce test` tools. Below is an example of a test file that only runs the second test if the `long` label is activated.

```yaml
tests:
  - name: Short Test
    command: ./run_short_tests
{% if long %}
  - name: Long Test
    command: ./run_long_tests
{% endif %}
```

## Running Tests After a Build

Tests can be run immediately after a build has completed by passing the `--run_tests` argument to `open-ce build env`. Tests will be run for every package that was built (but not until every package has been built). Tests will be run for every combination of build variants that were specified by the build command. For example, if `python_versions` is set to `3.6,3.7`, tests will be run for the python 3.6 packages and python 3.7 packages. For more information on the `open-ce build env` command, see [doc/README.open_ce_build.md] (README.open_ce_build.md).

## `open-ce test env` sub command

The `open-ce test env` command can be used to run tests for every package listed within an Open-CE Environment [file](README.yaml.md). Tests will be run for every combination of build variants that are specified. For example, if `python_versions` is set to `3.6,3.7`, tests will be run for the python 3.6 packages and python 3.7 packages.

### Command usage for `open-ce test env`

                        env_config_file [env_config_file ...]

positional arguments:
  env_config_file       Path to the environment configuration YAML file. The configuration
                        file describes the package environment you wish to build.

                        A collection of files exist at https://github.com/open-ce/open-ce-environments.

                        This argument can be a URL, in which case imported_envs and the conda_build_config
                        will be automatically discovered in the same remote directory. E.g.:
                        >$ open-ce build env https://raw.githubusercontent.com/open-ce/open-ce-environments/main/envs/opence-env.yaml

                        For complete documentation on Open-CE environment files see:
                        https://github.com/open-ce/open-ce/blob/main/doc/README.yaml.md

## `open-ce test feedstock` sub command

The `open-ce test feedstock` command can be used to run tests for a specific feedstock. The `open-ce test feedstock` command should be run from within the feedstock directory that will be tested. A conda environment file must be passed in as an argument. A conda environment will be created before the tests are run based on the passed in conda environment file.

```shell
==============================================================================
usage: open-ce test feedstock [-h] [--conda_env_file CONDA_ENV_FILE]
                              [--test_working_dir TEST_WORKING_DIR]
